# A Time Series Analysis of Gold Prices
This project analyzes the time series behavior of gold prices using advanced statistical modeling techniques. The goal is to model and forecast gold price movements, accounting for both the mean and volatility dynamics. The analysis begins with an ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to capture the linear dependencies and trends in the gold price series. After identifying the optimal ARIMA model using autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions, the residuals are examined for volatility clustering, a common characteristic of financial time series. To model this volatility, a GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model is fitted to the residuals of the ARIMA model. The GARCH model captures the time-varying volatility and provides insights into the risk associated with gold price fluctuations. The performance of the models is evaluated
using diagnostic checks, including the Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation and the McLeod-Li test for ARCH effects. Finally, the fitted models are used to generate forecasts for future gold prices, along with confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining ARIMA and GARCH models for analyzing and forecasting gold prices, providing valuable insights for investors and policymakers.
